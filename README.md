## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In completing this challenge, I learned how to

- use the child combinator `>` to combine class selectors, *e.g.,*
```css
.image-wrapper:hover > .image-eye-wrapper {
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs: Child combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) - This is where I learned how to use the `>` combinator.
